## Week 1: Getting started

During this week we will post introductions, setup software, start thinking 
about project organization and begin reviewing linear models. 


### Posting introductions

Go to [the course discussion board on BlackBoard, enter the "introductions" forum](https://my.unl.edu/webapps/discussionboard/do/forum?action=list_threads&nav=discussion_board_entry&course_id=_165403_1&conf_id=_228448_1&forum_id=_258266_1)
, click "Create thread", and introduce yourself! What are you doing at NU? Please 
also post a photograph of yourself. This is mostly for my benefit. Otherwise,
we meet on campus somewhere and I've no idea why you know me but I don't know 
you! 

### Setup software

Before the first synchronous session on Tuesday, January 12, please install all the 
[software listed on the main course website](index.html#setup).

### Project Organization

Just me talking about organizing directories, sub-directories and filenaming.
