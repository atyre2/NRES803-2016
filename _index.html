  INTRODUCTION

  Edit the general explanatory paragraph below if you want to change
  the pitch.
-->
<p>
  This is a semester long course on Ecological Statistics at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. Any Nebraska University 
  graduate student may enroll using NRES 898 Special Topics. The course 
  is fully on-line, with synchronous help sessions every Friday afternoon at 2:00 pm, as
  well as Monday and Wednesday mornings at 10am-11am.
  This hands-on course focuses on variations of the linear model and model selection. The 
  goal is to equip students with the basic methods to analyse ecological data.
</p>

<!--
  AUDIENCE

  Explain who your audience is.  (In particular, tell readers if the
  workshop is only open to people from a particular institution.
-->
<p id="who">
  <strong>Who:</strong>
  The course is aimed at graduate students from Nebraska University.
  You should have a basic working knowledge of the statistical programming language R.
  You should be comfortable with estimating a linear model with normally distributed data,
  interpreting the results, and carrying out hypothesis tests on the overall model and 
  individual coefficients.

<h2 id="assessment">Assessment</h2>
<p>
  The primary goal of this course is skill building, but it <em>is</em> a
  university course and I do need to give you a grade. Each week I will have 
  you turn in a text file containing your answers to a set of challenges. The challenges
  are listed at the end of each lesson page. Each assignment is due at <em>5pm on Friday of
  of the week it is assigned.</em> Late assignments will receive a score of zero unless
  prior approval is granted. Each challenge will be worth 5 points,
  and I will give partial grades where possible. For example, in the first week there
  are 2 lesson pages with 5 challenges each. Therefore week 1 will be worth a total 
  of 50 points. The total number of points over the entire semester will be approximately
  13 * 50 = 650. There will be no challenges the first week, during spring break or during dead week. 
  I may have to adjust this as we go forward, but in general assume that each week's
  work contributes equally to your overall grade. The final percentage score will be
  converted into letter grades as follows:<br>
  &gt;90% A, &gt;80% but &lt/90% B, &gt;70% but &lt;80% C,  &gt;60% but &lt;70% D, and
  &lt;60% F. <br>
  Note that I am not grading attendance at the synchronous sessions. You are 
  welcome to skip those or jump ahead as you wish. <br>
  <strong>NOTE: I may choose to "live code" some sessions</strong>, rather than provide
  video tutorials. These sessions will be recorded but the quality will not be as good.
  I am doing this because I want to learn the best way to present this material, and to
  do that I need to try some experiments.

  <p>
    Git is a version control system that lets you track who made changes
    to what when and has options for easily updating a shared or public
    version of your code
    on <a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a>. You will need a
    <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/supported-browsers/">supported</a>
    web browser (current versions of Chrome, Firefox or Safari,
    or Internet Explorer version 9 or above).

        <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/files/">this list</a>.
        After installing Git, there will not be anything in your <code>/Applications</code> folder,
        as Git is a command line program.
        <strong>For older versions of OS X (10.5-10.8)</strong> use the
        most recent available installer labelled "snow-leopard"

  <p>
    When you're writing code, it's nice to have a text editor that is
    optimized for writing code, with features like automatic
    color-coding of key words.  The default text editor on Mac OS X and
    Linux is usually set to Vim, which is not famous for being
    intuitive.  if you accidentally find yourself stuck in it, try
    typing the escape key, followed by <code>:q!</code> (colon, lower-case 'q',
    exclamation mark), then hitting Return to return to the shell.
